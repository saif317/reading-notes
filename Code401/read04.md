## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- Better program design and higher code quality

- Detailed project documentation

- reduce the time required for project development

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- beforeEach() : run the test after the promise is resolved

- afterEach() : resolve the promise after the test passes

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

Tests have to be changed when requirements change

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

you can use the new keyword to instansiate a class on ES6

## Why REST?

Because it's more flexible

### functional programming : [a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

### Object-oriented programming : [a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

### class : a blueprint for creating objects

### super : a keyword that class the parent class of the object

### this : a keyword that calls the current class we are in

### Test Driven Development : [a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

### Jest : a JavaScript testing framework

### Continuous Integration : [the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project](<https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration#:~:text=Continuous%20integration%20(CI)%20is%20the,builds%20and%20tests%20then%20run.>)

### REST : [a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

### Data Model : [an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model)
