## Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms

a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance

## Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

control object creation, limiting the number to one but allowing the flexibility to create more objects if the situation changes, useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system

## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

it need to be compatible with REST design

## Router Middleware

Middleware that handles the changing of routes in a website application

## Dynamic Module Loading

Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory

## Singleton Pattern

a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance

## CRUD -> REST Method Matches

| HTTP   | CRUD           |
| ------ | -------------- |
| GET    | Create         |
| POST   | Read           |
| PUT    | Update/Replace |
| PATCH  | Update/Modify  |
| DELETE | Delete         |

## Mock Testing

creating a fake version of an external or internal service that can stand in for the real one
