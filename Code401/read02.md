## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

* `Put` updates everything `Patch` updates only the required fields

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

* [yaml-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-server)
* [fotch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fotch)
* [dyson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dyson)

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

* `200 OK` for successful

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

* SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol
    - protocol
    - uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications
    - only works with XML

  
* REST: Representational State Transfer
    - architectural pattern
    - uses Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device
    - work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.
