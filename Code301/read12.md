**Q: Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

**A:**

| SQL                                                                                | NoSQL                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)                 | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.        |
| SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based | NoSQL databases do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to. |
| SQL databases have predefined schema                                               | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data                             |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable                                              | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable                                             |
| SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language )                               | queries are focused on collection of documents                                        |

**Q:What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

**A:** complex query intensive environments

**Q: Give a real world example.**

**A:** Banks

**Q: What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

**A:** hierarchical data storage

**Q: Give a real world example.**

**A:** Big Data

**Q: Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

**A:** NoSql

**Q: Which type of database is best for scalability?**

**A:** Sql

**Q: What does SQL stand for?**

**A:** Structured Query Language

**Q: What is a realational database?**

**A:** A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data

**Q: What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

**A:** Logical Structure

**Q: What is a ‘schema’?**

**A:** The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system.

**Q: What is a NoSQL database?**

**A:** A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

**Q: How does it work?**

**A:** related data doesn't have to be split between tables.

**Q: What is inside of a Mongo database?**

**A:** Collections

**Q: Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why**

**A:** MongoDB, because it is schema-free, allowing you to create documents without having to define the structure of the document first

**Q: What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

**A:** NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have
