**Q: What is functional programming?**

**A:** is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

**Q: What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

**A:** a pure function is a computational analogue of a mathematical function, pure function is a function that has the following properties: The function return values are identical for identical arguments. The function application has no side effects.

**Q: What are the benefits of a pure function?**

**A:** The main advantage of using pure functions, derives from the fact that they don't have any side effects. When you call a pure function, you need not worry about anything, outside of which arguments you are passing to it.

**Q: What is immutability?**

**A:** Immutability is the idea that data or objects should not be modified after they are created.

**Q: What is Referential transparency?**

**Q: What is a module?**

**A:** A set of functions you want to include in your application.

**Q: What does the word ‘require’ do?**

**A:** include modules that exist in separate files.

**Q: How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

**A:** const variableName=require("path/to/module")

**Q: What do we have to do to make a module available?**
