- Expressions should be enclosed in `()`

- `&&` means `expression A` and `expression B`, so the two expresssions must be true

- `||` means `expression A` or `expression B`, so only one expression must be true

- the `for loop` is used when you need to run a block of code a specific number of times

- the `while loop` is used when you need to run a block of code until a certain condition is met

- the difference between `do while loop` and `while loop` is that it run atleast once
