## **CSS**

- Block-level elements start on a new line

- Inline elements flow in between surrounding text

- `position:static` each block level element sits on top of the other , its the default positioning of the boxs in `HTML`

- `position:relative` moves the element relative to its default position, the default position stays empty

- `position:absolute` the position is absolute and it can intersect other elements in the page

- `position:fixed` position's the element in relation to the browser window so it never leave the view of the user

- `z-index` controls which element sits on top of the other

- `float` send's the element to either far left or far right of the page
