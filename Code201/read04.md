## **HTML**

### **Links**

- Links are created using the `<a>` element

- you can use the `<a>` element to link other websites or other pages in the same website

- you can use `mailto:` inside an `<a>` to start up the users email program and send an email

- `target` will open the link in a new window

- you also link a scpecific part of the page

### **Layout**

- `<div>` is the most used `HTML` element to contain elements and organise them

- browsers have a default way of showing elements and they have to be manually changed to get the desired flow for the page

- we can use the `float` and `width` properties to control the web page and divide the elements into a grid

- dividing webpages onto grids gives it a professional look and make the design more flexible

- elements can have a fixed width regardless of the width of the screen or they can stretch and contract depending on the size of the page

- we should use `CSS` frameworks to ease the task of styling a website

- a website can have multiple `CSS` files

## **JavaScript**

### **Functions**

- functions are used to store a block of code for reuse instead of repeating the same code over and over again

- `function funcName(){`
  `code block;`
  `}`

- to call a function just type its name with `()` : `funcName()`

- the `()` can store variables that will be used in the function

-`function funcName(parm1,parm2){`
`code block;`
`}`

- `funcName(userParm1,userParm2)`

-the `return` keyword returns a value from a function wich can be used elsewhere
