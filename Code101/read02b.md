## Version Control

- the version control system creates a version of the files every time you make a change to them.  
- on a local version control system, every version is stored on a local database  
- on a centralized version control system, every version is shared on a server to which all collaborators have access.  
- the distributed version control system, allows collaborators to mirror the versions to prevent loss of data since there are multiple points of failure.  
- git is a distributed version control system.
