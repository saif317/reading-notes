- we use the _CLI_ as an extension to the _GUI_, it allows us to enter commands to control files in the _OS_.

- a _shell_ is a part of the _OS_ that defines how the _terminal_ behaves, the most common type of _shell_ is _bash_.

- `pwd` shows the current working directory, `ls` lists the files in the current working directory, `cd` allows us to navigate through the folders.

- everything in _Linux_ is a file, _Linux_ determines the file type by looking through its contents, _Linux_ is case sensitive.
